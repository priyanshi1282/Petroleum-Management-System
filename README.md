# Petroleum-Management-System
This project wasn’t expected but it made to be more specific and interesting for coder to code. As this have been implemented at every gas station &amp; we made it without any external reference. In this program following functions could be performed: - 1.Details of the tanker at station. 2.Details about the sale of petrol and diesel. 3.Delete created logs. 4.And many more… You can check for the source code and run it to understand what it is about.
